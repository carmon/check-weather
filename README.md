## Check weather node app

This is a rudimentary node app to check current weather conditions on a specified location.
It uses [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com) API, you must have an access_key provided by them when you make an account,
I only used 1 endpoint! Go check their API docs and have fun, they look neat.

The app is written in TypeScript so you need to transpile it to JavaScript by doing a `npm run build` before running `npm run start`. It uses the minimum required packages to do it's thing.

My motivation for making this app was to have a clean way to get my current city weather info, in order to check if it was raining at 8AM to check if my dog walker would come. Clone or fork it for whatever purpose you'd like.
